# Finance-Analysis

Welcome to the **Finance-Analysis** repository! This project is all about **Financial Data Analysis**, where we dive into financial datasets like stock prices, market trends, and company performance to extract insights for smarter decision-making. Using key metrics such as volatility, returns, and risk assessment methods, this repository showcases how to analyze financial data with Python in a **Google Colab** environment.

This project is designed as a collection of `.ipynb` notebooks, making it easy to run and experiment with financial analysis directly in the cloud.

## Project Overview

Financial data analysis involves examining and interpreting financial information to guide decisions. Here, you'll find:
- Interactive Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) hosted on Google Colab.
- Examples of analyzing financial metrics like volatility, returns, and risk.
- Visualizations to spot trends and patterns.
- A step-by-step guide to financial data analysis using Python.

The goal is to help you understand and apply financial data analysis techniques, all within the accessible and free Google Colab platform.

## Features
- **Data Sources**: Pull data from APIs like Yahoo Finance or use sample datasets.
- **Metrics Analyzed**:
  - Stock price movements
  - Volatility (e.g., standard deviation of returns)
  - Returns (daily, monthly, annualized)
  - Risk metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio)
- **Tools**: Python libraries such as `pandas` and `plotly`.
- **Environment**: Runs seamlessly on Google Colab with no local setup required.
